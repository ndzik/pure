# PURE - ndzik
With `TreeSitter` becoming available I realised how much of a benefit AST based coloring is for program understanding, debugging and intuition.
`PURE` is my take on a colorscheme, granted it is still in its infancy and has to be tweaked a lot.

# Credits
This colorscheme uses the `generate` ruby script and associated `libs` made by [felipec](https://github.com/felipec/vim-felipec), so all credits for that go to him.

# Semantics - TBD

## Color-Scheme
The colorscheme is available under `scheme/pure.vim`.
